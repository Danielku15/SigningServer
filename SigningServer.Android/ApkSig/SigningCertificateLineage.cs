     * APK Signer Lineage.
     *
     * <p>The signer lineage contains a history of signing certificates with each ancestor attesting to
     * the validity of its descendant.  Each additional descendant represents a new identity that can be
     * used to sign an APK, and each generation has accompanying attributes which represent how the
     * APK would like to view the older signing certificates, specifically how they should be trusted in
     * certain situations.
     *
     * <p> Its primary use is to enable APK Signing Certificate Rotation.  The Android platform verifies
     * the APK Signer Lineage, and if the current signing certificate for the APK is in the Signer
     * Lineage, and the Lineage contains the certificate the platform associates with the APK, it will
     * allow upgrades to the new certificate.
     *
